Glue UI is Cornell WebDev's centralized UI component library. It implements Cornell WebDev's Glue Design System and serves as a single source of truth for React components in our web applications.

Glue UI was built using:

- [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

## Development


### Building

```
npm run build
```

### Storybook

To run a live-reload Storybook server on your local machine:

```
npm run install
npm run storybook
```

To export your Storybook as static files:

```
npm run storybook:export
```


### Generating New Components

```
npm run generate InsertComponentName
```

## Publishing

### Hosting via NPM

```
npm login
npm publish
```

The `"prepublishOnly": "npm run build"` script in `package.json` will execute before publish occurs, ensuring that the changes have compiled into the build directory before being published.


## Usage

```
npm install glue-ui
```

```TSX
import React from "react";
import { ExampleComponent } from "glue-ui";

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello I'm consuming the component library</h1>
    <ExampleComponent />
  </div>
);

export default App;
```

#### Styled Components

If you want to use [`styled-components`](https://styled-components.com/), the changes required are a bit more involved. As such, I've created a branch where I've got `styled-components` working in this component library, [check it out here](https://github.com/HarveyD/react-component-library/tree/styled-components).

### Component Code Splitting

Code splitting of your components is not supported by default.

[Read this section of my blog post](https://blog.harveydelaney.com/creating-your-own-react-component-library/#introducing-code-splitting-optional-) to find out how and why you would enable code splitting of your components. In summary, code splitting enables users to import components in isolation like:

```
import TestComponent from 'harvey-component-library/build/TestComponent';
```

This can reduce the bundle size for projects using older (CJS) module formats.

You can check out [this branch](https://github.com/HarveyD/react-component-library/tree/code-splitting) or [this commit](https://github.com/HarveyD/react-component-library/commit/94631be5a871f3b39dbc3e9bd3e75a8ae5b3b759) to see what changes are neccesary to implement it.

Please note, there's an issue with code splitting and using `rollup-plugin-postcss`. I recommend using `rollup-plugin-sass` instead alongside code splitting.

### Supporting Image Imports

Add the following library to your component library [@rollup/plugin-image](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/image):

```
npm i -D @rollup/plugin-image
```

Then add it to `rollup-config.js`:

```
...
plugins:[
  ...,
  image(),
  ...
]
...
```

You can then import and render images in your components like:

```tsx
import logo from "./rollup.png";

export const ImageComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <img src={logo} />
  </div>
);
```

### Supporting JSON Imports

Add the following library to your component library [@rollup/plugin-json](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/json):

```
npm i -D @rollup/plugin-json
```

Then add it to `rollup-config.js`:

```
...
plugins:[
  ...,
  json(),
  ...
]
...
```

You can then import and use JSON as ES6 Modules:

```tsx
import data from "./some-data.json";

export const JsonDataComponent = () => <div>{data.description}</div>;
```
